# ReactorMyst
Explore inside the images of the original Myst game, with world models generated by [Reactor AI](https://docs.reactor.inc).  
For the [Supercell AI Hackathon](https://luma.com/qkcem6mi?tk=8KsXwz).  
Build steps on [Reactor's Github](https://github.com/reactor-team/reactor-experiments/tree/main/worldcore#getting-started).  
The seed images for the AI are actual screenshots of the original Myst, so this project is for tech/idea validation only, not viable for distribution.
