# ReactorMyst
Explore inside the images of the original Myst, with world models generated by [Reactor AI](https://docs.reactor.inc).  
Developed for the [Supercell AI Hackathon](https://luma.com/qkcem6mi).  
Follow the same build steps on [Reactor's Github](https://github.com/reactor-team/reactor-experiments/tree/main/worldcore#getting-started).  
Web frontend modifications by _Gemini 3 Pro (Low)_ in Google Antigravity.  
The seed images for the AI are actual screenshots of the original Myst, so this project is for tech/idea validation only, not viable for distribution.

## Findings
The interactive world models generated by Reactor AI includes some physics like gravity, and it seems to always derive that these images have terrain that's slanted to the right.  
So the user (camera) is always sliding to the right by default, if there's no manual movement to the left to counter it.  
Sending commands for `set_keyboard_action` to `still` or `set_movement_speed` to `0` after the images load did not prevent sliding from continuing.
